        "I developed this project using the Yelp Fusion API, JavaScript, Express, HTML, CSS, and Netlify. I taught myself the technologies above to build a responsive and engaging website. This includes making API requests via the backend using Express and dynamically displaying the response on the frontend. I accomplished this by learning about CORS and taught myself the setup and initialization phases when hosting my project on Netlify.",
